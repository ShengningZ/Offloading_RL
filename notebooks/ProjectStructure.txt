checkpoints/
-State machine
This directory is used to save the state of your machine learning models at specific intervals during training. These saved states, known as checkpoints, allow you to pause and resume training or to load a trained model directly without needing to train it again from scratch. This is particularly useful for long training sessions or when experimenting with different model configurations.

config/

The config directory stores configuration files for your project. These files can contain settings for your machine learning models, environment parameters, or any other configurable aspects of your project. Storing configurations in separate files (often in JSON or YAML format) makes your code cleaner and your experiments more reproducible, as you can easily change settings without altering your code.

data/
This folder contains the datasets used by your project. Depending on your project, this could include raw data files (like CSV, JSON, or images), processed data, or even scripts to download or generate data. Organizing your data separately helps in managing different datasets and versions, especially when working with large or multiple datasets.

logs/
The logs directory is used to store output logs from your training sessions or runtime. Logs can include information about training progress, performance metrics, errors, or any other events that occur during execution. Keeping logs helps in monitoring your models' training progress and debugging issues.

notebooks/
Jupyter Notebooks or other interactive notebooks are stored in the notebooks folder. Notebooks are valuable for exploratory data analysis, visualization, testing new ideas, and documenting your research process. They combine code, output (like charts), and narrative text in a single document, making them great for sharing insights and results.

requirements.txt
This file lists all the Python packages your project depends on. You can create this file by running pip freeze > requirements.txt in your virtual environment. It allows anyone who wants to run your project to easily install all its dependencies at once using pip install -r requirements.txt.

scripts/
The scripts directory contains standalone scripts that perform specific tasks related to your project. These might include data preprocessing, batch training jobs, evaluation scripts, or any utility scripts that help automate repetitive tasks. Separating these scripts from your main source code keeps your project organized and modular.

src/
This is the main source code directory for your project. It typically includes:

    environment.py: Defines the reinforcement learning environment.
    models/: Contains the definitions and architecture of your machine learning models.
    main.py: The entry point of your project, which might tie everything together, run experiments, or start training processes.

tests/
In the tests directory, you store tests for your project's code. Writing tests for your functions and classes ensures that your code works as expected and helps you catch bugs early. This is especially important in larger projects or when working in teams. You can use testing frameworks like unittest or pytest for this purpose.
