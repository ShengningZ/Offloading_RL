Detect Objects (step_detect_objects)
-background subtraction
-The result is a binary image (mask) where the foreground objects are white, and the background is black.
-Then the next step applies a binary threshold to the mask obtained from background subtraction. 
It enhances the separation between the foreground objects and the background.
-get Contours Output: contours is a Python list of all the contours found. 
Each contour is represented as a numpy array of (x, y) coordinates of boundary points of the object.
-Filters out small contours to ignore noise and small, irrelevant objects.

step_predict_state
-The kf.predict() call invokes the predict step of the Kalman filter. This step uses the current state and the 
system's dynamic model (encoded in the transition matrix and the process noise covariance) to estimate the state
 at the next time step.

Feathers can be added-
1. Data Association

When tracking multiple objects,need to match each new measurement to the correct track. 
This is known as data association.

    -Nearest Neighbor: Simple but effective; associate measurements to the nearest predicted state.
    -Hungarian Algorithm: More sophisticated and efficient for solving the assignment problem in polynomial time, 
    especially useful when you have multiple objects to track and match with measurements.

2. Multi-object Tracking

Extend the system to handle multiple objects simultaneously, requiring more advanced data association and state 
management.

    Maintain Multiple Kalman Filters: One for each tracked object. This requires dynamically creating, updating, 
    and deleting Kalman filter instances based on object detections and disappearances.

3. Handling Occlusions

Objects being tracked might occlude each other. Handling occlusions robustly can significantly improve tracking 
performance.

    Occlusion Detection: Implement logic to detect when objects are occluding each other and adjust tracking 
    accordingly, perhaps by predicting the state of occluded objects without updating their states until they 
    become visible again.

4. Smoothing and Interpolation

For missed detections or to smooth out the trajectories, implement post-processing steps.

    Trajectory Smoothing: Use smoothing algorithms like a moving average or Savitzky-Golay filter to smooth the 
    trajectories of tracked objects.
    Interpolation: For frames where detection fails or objects are occluded, interpolate their positions based 
    on their last known states and velocities.

5. Dynamic Model Adjustments

Adjust the dynamics model of the Kalman filter based on the observed behavior of tracked objects.

    Adaptive Process Noise: Dynamically adjust the process noise covariance of the Kalman filter to account 
    for changes in object motion dynamics (e.g., sudden accelerations).

6. Quality of Tracking Metrics

Implement metrics to evaluate the quality of tracking, such as tracking accuracy, drift, and occlusion handling.

    Tracking Accuracy: Measure how closely the tracked positions match ground truth (if available) or detections.
    Drift: Monitor the drift of tracked objects over time to detect when reinitialization might be necessary.

7. Machine Learning for Detection

Incorporate machine learning models for more accurate and robust object detection.

    Deep Learning Models: Use models like YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN for object detection. These models can 
    provide more accurate and class-specific detections, which can be directly fed into the Kalman filter for 
    tracking.

Implementation Considerations

    Computational Resources: Advanced functionalities, especially deep learning models for detection, require
     significant computational resources. Consider offloading compute-intensive tasks to GPUs or dedicated hardware.
    Real-time Processing: Ensure that the additional computations do not hinder the system's ability to process 
    video frames in real-time. Optimization and parallel processing might be required.
    Modularity: Keep the system modular, allowing for easy updates, testing of individual components, and 
    integration of new functionalities.

By implementing these additional functionalities and calculations, you can significantly improve the robustness,
 accuracy, and capabilities of your object tracking system, making it more suitable for complex real-world scenarios.


Before adding feathers,
We can start an offloading first:
    1. Prototype Development: Start with implementing a basic offloading mechanism for one of the tasks 
    (e.g., object detection) to test the workflow.
    2. Performance Testing: Measure latency and power consumption for different offloading configurations
     to find the optimal setup.
    3. Iterative Optimization: Use the insights from testing to refine your offloading strategy, adjusting
     serialization, compression, and batching techniques as needed.
    4. Scalability and Robustness: Once the basic offloading mechanism is optimized, ensure the system is 
    scalable and can handle errors gracefully, including network failures or server downtime.
